# CAD-Model

If have not installed a software that enables you to open CAD-models, I highly recommend doing so. It will make it much easier to build this project and make modifications. The provided .f3z-file will enable you to do so, if you use Autodesk Fusion 360.

Here is a list of free software to open STEP-models, I canrecommend:

- [eDrawings](https://www.edrawingsviewer.com/download-edrawings)
- [Autodesk Viewer](https://viewer.autodesk.com)
- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org)



### Design Note

I have expierneced that Fusion takes up significant anounts of RAM while in Design. This might be a result of suboptimal design methology. Due to the complicated nature of the project, a diffenent approach in design workflow is not possible and would result in complications when doing modifications or general changes to the assembly.
