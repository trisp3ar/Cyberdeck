(decreasing importance)
 1. robustness - water, dustproof and rugged
 2. radiation resistants - EMI-proof
 3. low-level integration
 4. good maintainability
 5. high modularity and adaptability
 6. wide-range usability
 7. large amount of interfaces
 8. RF-capibility - communication is key
 9. data storage
 10. Linux Kali as basis for a secure and capable system
